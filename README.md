# Danubia

Tactical RPG engine, intended primarily as a proof-of-concept.

## Installation

Danubia uses [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and does not require any external libraries, crates, or software (for now).
This will change once I start working on the GUI.

## Usage

Run `cargo run` and follow the directions.
Right now, Danubia is only capable of playing through a test scene.
It is more-or-less fully functional, but uses an extremely unfriendly CLI.
